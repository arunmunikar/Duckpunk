Akash (a Canadian from Vancouver Island who has lived in Nepal for over a decade) started his travels at the age of 19 by exploring the world's rich tea cultures & customs. The genuine hospitality that greeted him along the way was a pleasant surprise; it didn't take long before he was introduced into the world of food.<br><br>
Nepal has more than 100 ethnic groups, and Akash fell in love with the Newars of Kathmandu. After hearing through 'the wind' about a community-led foodie village, he 'started a foot' to find out if such rumors were in fact real. After discovering the ancient village of Kirtipur, with its tiny cobbled streets, and falling in love at first site, he found home.<br><br>
The air is thickly filled with a unique odor of rubbing alcohol coming from the endless moonshine distilleries that are found at the basements of most Newari's house. Then there is the scent of barbecues that the wind blows through village. Phalcha's (Newari resting points) are scattered on each corner, where old men sit and gamble away. The locals are filled with genuine Namaste (hello) and with were curious about a Khaire (white man) walking through their village. This led to Akash soon being introduced to Sujen Manandhar.

Sujen Manandhar is not your typical villager. He was born with his reputation on the line, nowhere to escape, the grandson of the Legendary Chef 'Guru Cha'. Guru Cha open Kirtipur's first tavern in 1937 at the age of 12, and by his mid-twenties he captured the heart of the locals and named master chef & brew master by the community. Being a harden bar owner, Guru Cha ran his kitchen with an iron fist, slowly passing on the knowledge onto his son, Jay Manandhar. The grueling job started every day at 4 in the morning, by fetching water from the streams to make fresh moonshine. Endless kitchen prep work followed before before the taverns doors could open.<br><br>
The family grew, Jay Manandhar married Meena, a Newari from Banepa Kathmandu, and together worked the family business under the strict tutelage of Guru Cha. The newlyweds were being groomed to take over the family business.<br><br>
The Newari community has endless festivals (bhoj), at times 15 in a month. Despite the relentless tavern hours, from 4 in the morning to midnight, Jay Manadhar was also expected and trained to be a master chef at these festival gatherings, which no less than 500 people attended.<br><br>
Sujen Manandhar, grandson of Guru Cha, was born in 1982 to Jay & Meena Manandhar. He became the third generation to become an apprentice and learn the family craft,<br> the art of cooking and the family moonshine recipe, until a tragic event would shape the lives of the Manandhar family forever.
One day, a high-ranking police officer was transferred to Kirtipur from another village. The police station sat across the street from the family's tavern. This officer was from different ethnic group and demanded Guru Cha put goat on the menu. This request infuriated Guru Cha, being a Newari, who predominately ate buffalo, being insulted not only refused, he told him to fuck off & get out. The next day the Officer walked in and told Guru Cha you will go to jail until you serve goat meat. Being a good son, Jay Manandhar said, 'No, Dad.  I will take your place.' Jay Manandhar spent one day in jail. After he was let out, he looked at his father firmly in the eyes and said, 'Dad, I don't want to do this business anymore.'  In an instant, the family legacy ended. The community was left speechless as Jay Manandhar walked out to start his own legacy, away from family tavern. He opened a community grocery story in 1998. It is still being run to this date.
